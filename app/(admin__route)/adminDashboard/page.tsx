        eSwaraj is one of the applications developed as part of Panchayat
        Enterprise Suite (PES) under e-panchayat Mission Mode Project (MMP) of
        Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR). eSwaraj aims to bring in better
        transparency and strengthening the e-Governance in Panchayati Raj
        Institutions (PRIs) across the country through decentralized planning,
        progress reporting and work-based accounting. Furthermore, eSwaraj will
        assist in enhancing the credibility of Panchayats which would induce
        greater devolution of funds to PRIs as well as provide a platform for
        effective monitoring by higher authorities.
